description:Good evening Twitter, It’s me the funny music man. I made Brimstone and Isotope, and remade MissingNo (because I felt like it, and people are gonna get mad at me for it for no reason). It’s been an awesome 7 months working on this, Lullaby is packed to the brim with a lot of quality and quantity, that will definitely blow people away, and I’m proud of everyone who worked on this motherfucker. Thanks for playing :]
