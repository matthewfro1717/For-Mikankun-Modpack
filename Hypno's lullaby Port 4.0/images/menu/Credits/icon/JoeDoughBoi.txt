description:I was brought on after finding out about Pasta Night. I originally was just meant to overview the Lord X sprites but I ended up volunteering to help design the background characters and level layout. It was awesome trying to fit as many references as we could, and I'm grateful that the team was as open as they were with it. The Hypno dev team is amazing, and working with them has been nothing but a pleasure. Also, staying up and watching Spy x Family was one of the many highlights I've had :')
