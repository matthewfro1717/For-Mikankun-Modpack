description:Hey, I'm Shubs, a programmer :P\nFor the past few months I've worked on the majority of this project like its menus, songs, mechanics and more. My favorite part of this mod was Brimstone, bringing it together was such a unique experience that involved a lot of us. This team is like a group of friends to me, and working with them has been incredibly fun!\n\nIt's not without its setbacks, but nothing truly is, being able to help direct and collaborate on such a massive project has given me so much experience. Thank you for playing!
