description:ayo, I’m Adam, but you can call me Adam McHummus, I’ve done a fair bit of music for some very popular fnf mods, nothing too special, although hypno will always be an epic mod to work on, with all the people I’ve met and befriended here, it was worth it in some ways, I looked up to banbuds when i first heard about him and getting the chance to work on a mod with him was huge for me, and hey, look at me now, we’re already on v2 and I’ve made so much cool shit, I really hope y’all enjoyed it as much as I did working on it,,
