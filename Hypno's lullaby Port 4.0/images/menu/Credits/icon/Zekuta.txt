description:What's up, playa'? I'm the guy who made the Hypno sprite for Pasta Night. But that's not the important part. How I ended up in this team is a mystery, but to work with all of these talented people is a treat.  Whether I met some of them prior or after joining the team, it's been a real pleasure getting to know them. I've learned a thing or two from a few fellow artists here and I'm grateful for that. Now that's out of the way, here's to a goated update to a goated mod. Now keep scrolling down. There's more goated people you need to check out. ;).
