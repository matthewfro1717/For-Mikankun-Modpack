description:hi I’m xoop, I’m on a couple of mods not many notable ones because I am notorious for working slow LMAO I did one of the promo arts and helped with the barebones of gold’s death animation that has been remade one too many times T_T I’m eternally grateful I was able to work on this project, Hypno was one of my all time favorite mods when I was just a teeny baby mod artist and the fact that I’ve come this far to work on it for V2, even if it was barely anything, is so crazy to me. I hope you guys enjoy this as much as I do!!!!
