description:Heya. The name's ScorchVx, but you can call me Scorch for short, or Scronch, or Spoink, or however you wanna screw up my name. I’m a huge fanatic when it comes to horror and especially creepypastas, and ever since I’ve joined this team, it’s been one hell of a ride. I never thought I’d partake in a project like this for a while. Throughout the time I’ve worked on Lullaby, I’ve drawn up tons of concept art, backgrounds, jumpscare portraits, provided voicework, and on top of that actually doing ANIMATION?! IT’S ALL SO SURREAL! I still remember when I was first invited to the Hypno team, all I had to do for v1 was make a background or two and maybe do a few sketches of concept art here and there. Ever since we started on v2, I was granted with even more creative freedom as time went on and it only got better from there. I’m extremely proud of everything me and the rest of the team have been busting our asses off to make, and I still get giddy every time I see our efforts come together to make probably one of my favorite mods I’ve ever worked on. I can’t thank Banbuds enough for giving me this opportunity and the rest of the team for giving it their all to make Hypno's Lullaby a reality. I hope you’ve all enjoyed :D
