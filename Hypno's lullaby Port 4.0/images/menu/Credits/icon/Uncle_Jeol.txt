description:Jeol here. I've been spriting for this mod since I did the v1 Missingno assets, it's been an amazing ride, and I love this fucking team to death. This project has let me go nuts with pixel art and I even had a go at some flash-style stuff, which was a great experience. I hope everyone who plays it has a blast! If you don't I'm filling your house with gas.
