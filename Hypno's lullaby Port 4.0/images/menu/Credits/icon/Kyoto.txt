description:I'm simply some other guy, a Mexican if you will. I've been in the fnf modding scenery for a long long long long time now but have never been part of a huge project like this one. Banbuds Got me to work on this and I am so grateful for being part of such a ambiguous project with people who have such ambiguous visions. I've had a huge art change only from the inspiration I've gotten looking at other fellow members being here and my experience within the dev team, which have been one hell of a ride, Its got its ups and its got its downs but that's what's part of the ride, something I wont be forgetting about any time soon. And to my friends, who have lifted me up in my worst, I thank you the most. Your all the reason I can stand up in my legs to be able to have spirit to do the things I do. I owe you all the world and more
